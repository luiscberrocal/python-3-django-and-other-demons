#Introduction

##Python 3, Django and Other Demons version {{ book.version }}


Most tutorials Django tutorials will start with the creation of the first app.

Configuring the environments can be sometimes cumbersome and confusing if you don't do this often enough.

The following diagram (built with [Gliffy](https://www.gliffy.com/)) shows the steps to follow in order to 
star a new Django project.

## How the book was created

This book started as  Word document with a bunch of print screens to help me remember the steps I followed to create a Django project and publish it to Heroku.

Along the way I started addinh notes because some times the print screens didn't jogged my memory.

I hesistated for some time to publishing the pdf finding it pretencious to call it a book. The I ran into a couple of slides in slideshare.com and realized that my Word document was a slide show with comments and hints.
